Hey, I'm **Matthews**!

I'm a passionate programmer who loves experimenting and exploring tools. I prefer the CLI over GUIs and enjoy automating my daily tasksâ€”even if it means spending 5 hours to automate a 2-minute job ðŸ˜„. Writing scripts and exploring new technologies are my favorite pastimes.

I'm particularly interested in cloud computing, REST APIs, CLI tools, scripting languages, and FOSS. I also enjoy contributing to OpenStreetMap (mapping is my hobby!), Wikimedia, and etc in my free time.
